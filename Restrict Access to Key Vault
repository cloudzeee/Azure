To allow selected networks access to an Azure Key Vault, you can configure the Key Vault firewall and virtual network (VNet) settings. Follow these steps:

---

### **1. Navigate to the Key Vault**
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Go to **Key Vaults** and select the Key Vault you want to configure.

---

### **2. Access Networking Settings**
1. In the left-hand menu of the Key Vault, click **Networking** under the **Settings** section.

---

### **3. Configure the Firewall and Virtual Networks**
1. **Select the access configuration**:
   - Under **Public access**, choose **Selected networks**.
   
2. **Add Virtual Networks**:
   - In the **Virtual networks** section, click **Add existing virtual network**.
   - Select the **Subscription**, **Virtual Network**, and **Subnet** where access to the Key Vault is required.
   - Click **Add**.

3. **Add IP Address Ranges (Optional)**:
   - In the **Firewall** section, add any specific IP address ranges or individual IPs that should be allowed access.
   - Enter the IP address or range in CIDR notation (e.g., `203.0.113.0/24`).

---

### **4. Enable Service Endpoints for the Virtual Network (if applicable)**
1. Navigate to the Virtual Network you added in the Azure portal.
2. Go to **Subnets**, and select the subnet you want to configure.
3. Under **Service Endpoints**, add **Microsoft.KeyVault** as a service endpoint.
4. Save the changes.

---

### **5. Test the Access Configuration**
1. Use a client (e.g., a VM in the allowed network or an application running in an allowed subnet) to access the Key Vault.
2. Confirm that unauthorized networks are blocked.

---

### **6. Save and Apply the Configuration**
1. In the Key Vault Networking settings, click **Save** to apply your changes.
2. Ensure that the Key Vault's firewall and network rules are updated successfully.

---

### **7. (Optional) Configure Access Policies**
Ensure that Azure Active Directory (AAD) identities (users, groups, or service principals) from the allowed networks also have proper access permissions in **Access Policies**.
