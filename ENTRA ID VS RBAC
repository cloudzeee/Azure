Microsoft Entra ID and Azure RBAC handle these different responsibilities.
🔹 What is Microsoft Entra ID & Its Roles?
📌 Microsoft Entra ID is Azure’s identity & access management (IAM) system. It controls who can sign in and manage things like users, groups, and applications. https://lnkd.in/dnK5TeE7
✅ Example:
Global Administrator – Has full control over identity and security settings (like the CEO of the company).
📢 Key takeaway: Microsoft Entra ID manages identities & authentication—not cloud resources

📌 Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) manages who can access and modify Azure cloud resources (e.g., virtual machines, databases, storage accounts).
💼 Azure RBAC Roles = Permissions for managing cloud infrastructure.
📢 Key takeaway: Azure RBAC manages access to cloud resources—not user identities!

Here's an example of a simple use-case:
💡 You hire a new DevOps Engineer.
 ✅ Assign them the User Administrator role in Microsoft Entra ID so they can add new employees.
 ✅ Assign them the Contributor role in Azure RBAC so they can deploy & manage cloud resources.
💡 Scenario 2: You bring in an external consultant to audit your cloud costs.
 ✅ Assign them Reader access in Azure RBAC so they can view cloud usage.
 ✅ No need to assign Microsoft Entra ID roles unless they need access to manage users.
